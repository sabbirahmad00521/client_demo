               <p>Lou Storiale has had the pleasure of working with great organizations. Here are some comments from

                  <p>ETS Investigations has utilized Lou's services on multiple occassions over the last year. I would
                     highly recommend him to companies large and small as he is one of the most knowledgeable
                     professionals in the industry. His attention to detail was paramount in developing our web rankings
                     and literally creating our web presence from scratch. Thank you for all your help Lou!!

               <div class="single-testimonial">
                  <p>Let me start out by saying I really do appreciate what Lou did for my business!
                  </p>
                  <p>I had hired a web designer and web developer in Dec 2008. By the time I had hired Lou my very
                     expensive website had YET to be launched (and this was May 2010). So when I called Lou my website
                     was 8 months past due.
                  </p>
                  <p>Lou stepped up and kicked some tail feather. He got all the pieces in place and created working
                     plans for everyone to complete (even me).
                  </p>
                  <p>From here on out I will not do another project without Lou. Since the website has launched Lou has
                     taught me so much about SEO, etc that it's mind boggling.
                  </p>
                  <p>Lou is a must have for any website project or marketing plan. Hire him!

               <div class="single-testimonial">
                  <p>I contacted Lou with a rough budget proposal for designing a website from scratch. It is a project
                     for a website that a friend and I initiated and now, wish to realize in form of a website. The
                     feedback and input I received from Lou was just astonishing and absolutely overwhelming.
                  </p>
                  <p>I really didn't expect such great in depth feedback and advice without even paying from it! Very
                     knowledgable and reflective. It seriously blew my mind since favors like that I feel are unusual
                     these days. I can only highly recommend Lou without any reservation!

                  <p>Lou Storiale and I have known each other since 1995. He approached me offering some suggestions for
                     my website. I had been online for 6 years and was not getting any rankings.
                  </p>
                  <p>I conceived of my website like a business card, more for validation than for marketing. Lou showed
                     me how inefficient my site was; I couldn't even find my website when I put my own name into Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>After 9 weeks, Lou had my website on Google's first page and ranking well for many keywords
                     important to my profession. At Lou's suggestion, we decided that we needed an even better strategy.
                     We changed the site to a WordPress Design. While keeping costs low, Lou created a remarkable number
                     of additional pages of content -- not only to educate visitors about our company's services, but
                     also to extend our reach online.
                  </p>
                  <p>The new site launched successfully as http://ETSInvestigate.com at the end of December; we
                     anticipate even better search results in the coming weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>I will be updating this review again in February to let others know about the great job Lou
                     Storiale is doing to quickly produce results and bring ETS into the 21st century with regard to
                     online marketing.

                  <p>Clearly the best marketing company in Chicago. Lou treated me and my window tinting company like we
                     were a fortune 500 company.
                  </p>
                  <p>My site is on Google's first page for over 22 different keyword phrases, so his search engine
                     optimization is excellent. I didn't have anything in my budget for a custom website design, but Lou
                     created a site anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>I now have over 36 reviews on Google, a great blue collar website, and people compliment my
                     business all the time. They choose me because I listed to Lou and did what he told me to back in
                     March. He knows his business.
                  </p>
                  <p>Lou also helped me earn an extra $30,000 using pay per click ads. i didn't know anything about
                     them, but Storiale Consulting took the reigns and I began making money on day 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>I couldn't be happier with the work Lou and his team did. My business is back on its feet today -
                     and only after 6 months after Lou began working on my site and marketing online.

                     has a rather limited budget for marketing. In these challenging circumstances, Lou performed
                     exceedingly well.
                  </p>
                  <p>Lou rapidly, and with great vigor, created web sites for Institute scholars, donors and staff.
                     Under his tenure, traffic on our web site increased 70 percent.
