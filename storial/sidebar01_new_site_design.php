                  <p> The challenge of building your product around <b>breakthrough design</b> is that the design has to in fact be a breakthrough. And that means spending far more time or money than your competitors who are merely seeking a positive return.</p>

                  <p><b>Knowing where you stand and where you're headed is critical.</b>  If you have a negative return on design, go ahead and spend enough money to get neutral, asap. But <b>don't spend so much that you're overinvesting</b> just to get to neutral. Watching a local store build an expensive but not stellar custom building is the perfect example of this mismatch.                  </p>

                  <p>If you're betting the whole thing, building your service launch on design first, <b>skimping on design is plain foolish.</b> </p>
