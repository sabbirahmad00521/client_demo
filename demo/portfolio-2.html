               <h4>Background </h4>
               <p>When I began this project <b> the problem</b> was to create an app that would assist users with
                  decluttering their home of unwanted items, I immediately got excited about the project because I have
                  found myself in the situation of needing to get rid of unwanted items that I had accumulated over the
                  years countless times in my life and I knew that I wasn’t the only one. </p>
               <p>I started at the root of the problem by asking why do people buy things that ultimately become
                  unwanted? I dived into secondary research and Instantly found that people do not only hold on to
                  unwanted things, but they also spend money on unwanted things due to the idea of an emotional
                  connection. </p>
               <p>Having this understanding along with countless hours of research, interviews, and user testing helped
                  me reframe the idea to create an app that would allow users to feel good while getting rid of unwanted
                  items. As the lone UX professional on this project, I acted as a <b> UX Researcher, Information
                     Architect, Illustrator, Visual Designer </b> and <b>Strategist</b> for the project. </p>

               </h4>
               <p> I knew I needed to better understand the problem space so I started off my research process with
                  Secondary Research to see what others had already discovered. I was surprised to discover that
                  <b>Americans spend $1.2 trillion annually on nonessential goods—in other words, items they do not
                     need.</b> From there I knew I was on the right track.</p>

                  <li>The $8 billion home organization industry has more than doubled in size since the early
                     2000’s—growing at a staggering rate of 10% each year</li>
                  <li>Americans spend more on shoes, jewelry, and watches ($100 billion) than on higher education</li>
                  <li>Americans donate 1.9% of their income to charitable causes (<a

               </h4>
               <p>In order to make my potential solution market competitive, I went on a hunt to find apps and products that offer similar solutions. I chose the top 3 apps that attempted to alleviate these pain points which were Trashnothing, Freebie Alerts, and Free Stuff Listings. After conducting the analysis, I found that I was able to distinguish some things that will help me in the design process of my capstone project. After carefully reviewing 2/3 apps in full detail I notice trends in usability that did not seem pleasing to me, such as advertisements, prompts to sign up, and a lack of images to show what products are being offered.

               <p>Once I wrote a detailed report for each users, combined with my initial secondary research, I was left
                  with a large lump of data and insights within the subscription space. To sort these findings into
                  logical groupings, I created an <b>affinity diagram.</b> </p>
               <p>When I was creating the post-it notes to throw onto a blank wall, I started to discover patterns that
                  guided my groupings in an organic way. These groupings were:</p>
               <p>UX/UI Ideas</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Give to charities</li>
                  <li>Use of app</li>
                  <li>Sell items first</li>
                  <li>Feelings</li>
                  <li>Moving</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Through these patterns, the following <b>insights</b> were born:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Users are not fans of the Goodwill brand</li>
                  <li>Users often donate to charities</li>
                  <li>Users were frustrated with the use of classifieds apps</li>
                  <li>Users claimed an emotional attachment to unwanted items</li>
                  <li>Users feel good about donating to people in need</li>

               <p>As a way to establish empathy for my users, I created 5 <b>empathy maps.</b> I separated each map into
                  4 sections. The 4 main sections were: </p>

               <p>Following my empathy mapping process, I established 2 personas which are based on all my previous

               <ol>
                  <li>Kirsten “The Fashionista” Smith - Kirsten is a 28-year old independent social media manager who
                     has gotten frustrated with the idea of trying to sell on classified apps like poshmark or offerup.
                     She feels her clothes have value and although a buck would be nice, time is more important to
                     Kirsten, she truly values her time off. The idea of giving to someone in need of her items makes
                     her smile and is an ideal scenario for her. Her main concern is that the items do not end up in a
                     Goodwill sold for half of what she paid for them while not contributing to the community.</li>
                  <li>James “The Good Guy” Harper - James is a 33 year old teacher and student, he has accumulated lots
                     of things of the years, and he knows he needs to get rid of some stuff soon. James is also a busy
                     dad of 2. James has grown to have bad feelings towards the local Goodwill, but is on a time crunch
                     due to life obligations. With immoral feelings towards the Goodwill brand, James is desperately
                     seeking a church, a homeless shelter, or anywhere he can unload his unwanted items for a good
                     cause.</li>

                  and the app began to establish an identity. I created a <b>moodboard</b> through <b>Milanote</b> in

               <p>I chose bright colors to steer away from the traditional stuffy colors of classified apps and to keep

                  <b>giverr</b> , I started building a style guide in <b>Adobe Xd</b> . This guide included the
                  following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><b>Typography</b> - PT Sans, and PT Serif Font that is universal for all iOS devices.</li>
                  <li><b>Color</b> - A rich purple would be the main color with accents of bright blue and grey. Also,
                     gradients were chose to follow modern UI trends. </li>
                  <li><b>UI Components</b> - Buttons and shadows were all included in my Style Guide to create
                     consistency throughout my app.</li>

               <h4>High Fidelity Mockups & Prototype</h4>
               <p> I began the much anticipated process of creating my <b>high fidelity</b> mockups in <b>Adobe Xd</b>
                  at this point. I designed the screens based on the latest iOS iPhone screen size (896x414).</p>
               <p>I chose to use <b>Adobe Photoshop </b> to create a friendly and inviting image as the login splash
                  screen. My inspiration behind the image was the city skyline that gives the feeling of community. I
                  carried the gradient background on the screen and within the app. </p>
               <p>Throughout the app you'll see <b>bright gradients</b> contrasted <b>with white space and purple.</b> I
                  wanted to retain as much white space as possible so the app wasn't cluttered. </p>
               <p>From there I built a <b>clickable prototype </b> using <b>InVision</b> . </p>

               <p> <b>Don Norman</b> and <b>Jakob Nielsen</b> determined that the best number for Usability Testing is
                  5, so I scouted 5 people to test the InVision giverr Prototype. I did one <b>unmoderated user test</b>
                  through <b>TryMyUI</b> and four <b>moderated user tests.</b> </p>
               <p><b>Tasks:</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Tell me how you would donate critical needed items to an acceptor(charity).</li>

                  <li>3 out of 5 users sat in silence for a second after I asked them to “proceed” at the splash screen.
                  </li>
                  <li>2 out of 5 users asked “what is that square icon at the bottom footer?” not knowing that it was

                  </li>
                  <li>Added a thank you screen to give users the option to either get directions to acceptor(charity)
