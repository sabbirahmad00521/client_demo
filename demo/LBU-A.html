                           moment you inquire about one of our places. Your comfort is our top priority, so we go above
                           and beyond to be prompt in our communications and provide transparency prior to and during
                           your stay. </p>

                        <h4>Early or Late Check In Request</h4>
                        <p><b>*IMPORTANT*: As much as I would love to accommodate every guest that asks for an earlier
                              check in, it is very difficult for us to make exceptions. Often times we have back-to-back
                              bookings and our housekeepers need sufficient time to deep clean the unit. Early check-in
                              would only be possible if we don’t have guests leaving on the day of your arrival (please
                              send us a text via the app on the day of your arrival by 11:00 AM, and we will let you
                              know). If you want to guarantee early check-in/late check-out, we recommend booking those
                              open dates on either side of your stay, if available. Lastly, we don’t have a place for
                              luggage storage, unfortunately.

                           When the buttons flash green, turn the latch to unlock the deadbolt. To lock, type in the

                        <h4>GARAGE PARKING </h4>
                        <p>The Garage Remote - is located inside the apartment on the coffee table. Garage access is via
                           Nylic Ct (which is the alley behind the front house). Alley entrance is on W 11th St or and
                           W. 10th Street. <b>Your parking garage is # 4.</b> </p>
                        <p><b>NOTE:Parking is for COMPACT CARS ONLY (i.e. Mini Cooper or Nissan Versa). </b></p>
                        <p>The garage is for single car use and is VERY SMALL. Therefore, I do not recommend anything
                           larger than a subcompact car such as a Mini Cooper or Nissan Versa. If you chose to drive
                           anything larger than a compact vehicle then street parking is your next option. A parking
                           permit is not required to park on the street however, please be advised that street parking
                           is in short supply between 5pm-8am. Lastly, please return the garage remote to coffee table
                           upon departure or risk losing your security deposit.

                        </p>

                        <h4>Alley Access: </h4>
                        <p>Once you have parked your car then you may enter the property via the alley gate. To your
                           left is an access gate with “Private Property” sign attached. The key to the gate will be on
                           the coffee table along with the garage remote. You may access the apartment via this gate.
                           Please keep the gate locked at all times.</p>
