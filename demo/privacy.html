                            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                            <p>NetworkIP, LLC dba Elite Telecom considers your privacy important. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all those who provide us with their contact information while using our information, products, events, or services. This policy describes the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our publication subscribers, online media product users, and event registrants is collected, how that information might be shared, and how someone can request changes to the way their personal information is used or shared.</p>
                            <p>This privacy statement applies to websites operated by or on behalf of NetworkIP LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions and related companies ("NetworkIP").</p>
                            <p><strong>Information You Volunteer</strong></p>
                            <p>This policy applies to personally identifiable information ("personal information"), which is information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity (for example, name; addresses; telephone numbers; social security number; call records; wireless device location). Personal information does not include "anonymous" or "aggregate" information - neither of which is&nbsp;associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>
                            <p>We collect personal information about you when you use our services or otherwise interact with us. Such information includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Information you provide. We collect personal information when you sign up for and use our services, and when you email, call, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information when you sign up for voice or data services or purchase other products or services. We may also collect personal information when you call or email our customer care, enter information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for service. If you provide personal information to us in connection with a co-sponsored website, this policy will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor's policy will apply to their use of the information.</li>
                                <li>Information automatically collected. We use cookies and other Internet technologies to enrich your online experience by managing our website and email programs. Our cookies do not contain any information, in itself, that is personally identifiable. We automatically collect certain information, some of which may be associated with personal information, whenever you use our services or websites. For example, our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless device(s) you use, and the phone numbers you call using our services. When your computer web browser or other communication device accesses our websites, we automatically receive certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, and the web page you visited before visiting our site. Our network also automatically captures necessary routing information when you use our services to access the Internet from your wireless device.</li>
                                <li>Information from other sources. We may also obtain personal information about you from other sources. For example, we may obtain updated address information from our shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase personal information (for example, email lists, postal mail lists, demographic and marketing data) from others.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>How We Use Your Contact Information</strong></p>
                            <p>We may use your contact information for any of the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To send you notices for purchase or renewal of services, suspected abuse notification, and notice of termination of services due to abuse or suspected fraud.</li>
                                <li>To provide you with information about products or services you've ordered.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We use personal information for a variety of business purposes, including for example, to complete transactions and bill for products and services; verify your identity; respond to your requests for service or assistance; anticipate and resolve actual and potential problems with our products and services; create and improve products and services; suggest additional or different products or services; make internal business decisions about current and future offers; provide personalized service and user experiences; and protect our rights and property. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time by changing your profile options at <a href="https://www.helloearth.mobi">https://helloearth.mobi</a>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Information We Share with Third Parties</strong></p>
                            <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to unaffiliated third parties (parties outside the NetworkIP corporate family) to market their services or products to you. We may, however, disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>With your consent. We may disclose personal information about you to third parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in several ways, such as in writing; online, through "click-through" agreements; orally, including through interactive voice response; or when your consent is part of this policy or the terms and conditions pursuant to which we provide you service. Your consent is sometimes implicit. For example, if you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, you implicitly consent to our disclosure of your name and address to a third party shipping company to complete delivery.</li>
                                <li>To the primary account holder. We may disclose personal information of an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide personal information about you or your use of the service to them or others at their direction. When you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party's agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough personal information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.</li>
                                <li>Transaction processing. We may disclose personal information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, billing, shipping, customer care, and marketing), transactions on your behalf (for example, verification of your account information at your request to some third party business), or transfers related to your service (for example, number portability). We typically restrict by contract the manner in which these third parties may use and disclose personal information about you without your consent.</li>
                                <li>Business transfers. We may disclose personal information as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as a business asset in the transaction.</li>
                                <li>Legal process, protection of NetworkIP and others. We may disclose personal information or communications where we believe in good faith such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or respond to legal process (for example, lawful subpoena, court order, E-9-1-1 information); to enforce or apply agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products; to protect our rights or property; in connection with claims, disputes, or litigation; to protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services; to facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or if we determine disclosure is necessary in an emergency situation.</li>
                                <li>Certain information, such as your password and credit card information, is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>How We Keep Your Information Secure</strong></p>
                            <p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is under our control. For instance, when you provide sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) to our websites, we use transmission encryption technologies like Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Although we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information will not occur, we strive to prevent such occurrences.</p>
                            <p>Our practices and procedures are designed to limit personal information access to those NetworkIP employees and agents with a legitimate need to access such information. NetworkIP employees are bound by confidentiality obligations, which obligate them to protect the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Violations subject employees to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
                            <p>We retain personal information for as long as we have a business need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. When we dispose of personal information, we use reasonable procedures to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media). We will make reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that a security breach involving your personal information has occurred and creates a risk of identity theft or service disruption, or as otherwise required by law. Due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.</p>
                            <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
                            <p>NetworkIP websites are not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on our websites. Please discourage your children from providing any personal information about themselves to anyone in any public discussion areas.</p>
                            <p><strong>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</strong></p>
                            <p>Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a form of personal information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number. Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We won't intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this policy. However, you may designate other "authorized users" (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI.</p>
                            <p>We provide password protected online access to your account information through <a href="https://www.helloearth.mobi">https://helloearth.mobi</a>. Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device - including CPNI). The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users.</p>
                            <p><strong>Customer Care&nbsp;Monitoring</strong></p>
                            <p>We may monitor and record phone calls, emails, or other communications between you and Customer Care agents&nbsp;or other employees for training and quality assurance purposes and to review specific transaction requests.</p>
                            <p><strong>Directories</strong></p>
                            <p>We do not publish directories of our customers' wireless numbers. Nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer's prior consent.</p>
                            <p><strong>Terms of Use</strong></p>
                            <p>By using any of our websites, you consent to our use of your contact information as it is outlined in this privacy statement.</p>
                            <p>NetworkIP reserves the right to access and disclose personally identifiable information to comply with applicable laws, lawful government requests and court orders, or to investigate alleged fraud or violations of the Terms of Use of NetworkIP websites.</p>
                            <p>If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post the changes on this page. Users are encouraged to review this page for any changes. Your continued use of this site constitutes your acceptance of this entire privacy statement. NetworkIP will make reasonable efforts to inform existing customers of material changes to this privacy policy.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to Reach Us</strong></p>
