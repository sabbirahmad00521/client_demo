               <h2>Welcome</h2>
               <p>Many of us are obsessed with food and behavioural processes such as restricting, overeating, bingeing
                  and purging and/or constantly thinking about food and weight loss – and have no idea these could be
                  symptoms of addiction. </p>
               <p>I was labeled as ‘having an eating disorder’ for 30+ years. I tried many treatment programs – all
                  emphasized ‘moderation of all foods’ - including residential in-patient and outpatient programs,
                  psychotherapy and psychiatry (anti-depressants and other medications).
               </p>
               <p>When I saw my problem was addiction – I FINALLY found a recovery protocol that worked.
               </p>
               <p> And if you have the disease of addiction – I would be privileged to work with you!
               </p>
               <p>Addicts living in recovery are accomplished, creative, intuitive and intelligent – and often healthier
                  and wealthier than ‘normal’ people – once we learn how addiction works and how to manage it. </p>

               <h3>Is This Your Experience? </h3>
               <h5>Millions of people are struggling with mood, weight, eating and sleep issues. Many have tried
                  therapy, medication, surgery and different diets to feel better. <br>Yet nothing seems to last. </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-10">
               <p>You may need to be screened and professionally assessed for food addiction, if any of the following
                  apply to you: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>You are reactive or defensive at the suggestion of being food addicted</li>
                  <li>You gain weight even when following nutrition guidelines</li>
                  <li>You are obsessed with food, eating, dieting, body image – the thoughts never seem to stop</li>
                  <li>You cannot stop thinking about eating and food even when you have just eaten</li>
                  <li>You feel guilt or shame regarding your food and eating thoughts and behaviours and lie about what
                     and how you eat</li>
                  <li>You have a pattern of eating/restricting/bingeing and/or using alcohol/drugs to cope</li>
                  <li>You think life would not be worth living without your favorite foods</li>
                  <li>You have been diagnosed as ‘eating disordered’, told there are “no bad foods” and “to eat
                     everything in moderation” and it just doesn't work</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Don’t despair - there is light at the end of the tunnel! A food addiction is not a death sentence -
                  instead, you may find its a relief to know it is not your fault. And you can learn how to put it into
                  remission and live a life of freedom you never thought possible. <br> Since the mid-1980’s, the
                  trillion-dollar food industry has created and promoted irresistible ‘food-like substances’ that
                  literally re-wire the brain to crave more. And that is just the tip of the iceberg...

               <h3>About Me</h3>
               <p> <b>Occupation:</b>Jayn is a certified International Food Addiction Counselor and Addiction Recovery
                  Coach, specializing in assessment and treatment of food addiction, as well as ‘process’ addictions
                  including obsessive thinking and behaviour regarding food and body image, binge eating, purging and
                  dieting.</p>
               <p> <b>Education:</b> International Food Addiction Recovery Counselor Training, Addiction Recovery Coach,
                  Bachelor of Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies</p>
               <p><b>Bio:</b>Jayn suffered with addiction to alcohol and other drugs and became abstinent 24 years ago,
                  in 1995. At the same time she was also severely underweight and chronically binged, purged and was
                  obsessed with a negative body image and dieting. She was labeled as ‘eating disordered’ and tried
                  countless treatment programs and diets, including residential in-patient, outpatient, psychotherapy,
                  psychiatry (anti-depressants), plant medicine, 12-step programs, diet clubs, veganism, vegetarianism,
                  intuitive eating, mindfulness, paleo, keto, faith based, etc. before finally uncovering that she
                  actually suffered from food and eating process addiction. Only then was she able to arrest this
                  addiction outlet and enjoy a full life in recovery. <br><br> Today she is finally free from food and
                  related process addiction. She maintains her ideal body composition, is craving-free and lives with
                  purpose and connection. Her passion is helping others find recovery from this complex, controversial
                  and mis-understood addiction outlet.</p>

               <h3>What is SUGAR® </h3>
               <h6>Are you addicted to certain foods and/or eating behaviours? </h6>
               <p>SUGAR® is a structured evaluation tool that examines a client’s relationship with sugar/flour/food and
                  related consequences. Prior to the development of SUGAR® there was no diagnostic instrument available
                  for “food addiction”, other than screening tools including UNCOPE-S, Yale scale, and various
                  self-assessment questionnaires. </p>
               <p>SUGAR® is based on the diagnostic criteria for harmful use, pathological use and addiction to
                  mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs as described in the ICD-10 (International Classification of
                  Diseases) from WHO. Recent research shows sugar/flour, and highly processed foods can act as
                  psychoactive drugs on peoples’ reward system, especially those with a predisposition towards
                  addiction.
               </p>
               <p>SUGAR® is a tool for professionals who work with people who may have developed problematic or chemical
                  dependence (addiction) to sugar/flour/food. </p>
               <p>SUGAR® results determine whether a client has “harmful use” or “pathological use” (addiction) to
                  flour/sugar/food and the addiction development curve will show a client’s relationship with
                  sugar/flour/food in chronological order. It is a strong motivational tool and clinically proven to
                  increase client’s compliance with treatment protocol. </p>

               <h3>The Process </h3>
               <p>Jayn engages her clients in a thorough Pre-Assessment Evaluation (PAE) process to uncover their unique
                  physical, mental, emotional and behavioural challenges and strengths. If warranted, the next step is a
                  SUGAR® assessment interview.
               </p>
               <p>Finally, based on the PAE and SUGAR® results, Jayn will recommend a practical treatment recovery plan,
                  including: an initial abstinent food plan, educational material/information, recommendations for
                  specific laboratory tests and/or medical follow up, recommendations for exercise and sleep, and
                  appropriate community-based support. </p>
